# Cato General Principles

## Purpose
Cato (Chat at the Terminal Orchestrator) exists to provide maximum control over LLM interactions, tailored to specific user needs and idiosyncrasies. It is a chat client first, productivity client second.

## Core Philosophy

### Terminal-First
- Cato is a terminal application. Alternative frontends should use terminal paradigms.
- Separation of logic and display enables pluggable terminal frontends.
- Style configuration should be kept separate unless very specific to a frontend paradigm.

### Single User Focus
- Built for a single user on a single machine.
- Designed for users who are highly changeable, like to tinker and experiment.
- Configuration and architecture should be as flexible as possible.
- Multiple instances may run with different configurations simultaneously - users should manage collisions manually.

### Quality Over Convenience
- No tolerance for poor design decisions, bad architecture, or lazy coding.
- Core architecture must remain flexible and modular.
- Any component should be easily unplugged or switched out.
- Highest engineering standards required.

## Specification-Driven Development
- The functional specification is the bible for all development.
- The specification is not static - it must be kept updated at all times.
- Any decision that adds to or alters the specification must be documented with what changed and when.
- All development, design, and architecture decisions must be logged.

## Configuration Philosophy
- Configuration file driven as much as possible.
- YAML format with extensive inline documentation.
- **No hard-coded inline values** - all defaults stored in YAML, not as function/method defaults.
- User configuration overlays default configuration - only override what differs.
- A single key-value pair in user config is sufficient; all other values fall back to defaults.
- Use Pydantic extensively for validation.
- Unrecognised config items should warn but not crash - continue with defaults.

## Dependency Management
- Favour the Pydantic stack for API interactions (pydantic-ai over LangChain).
- Minimise external library dependencies where existing approved dependencies suffice.
- Do not code natively what can be done with approved dependencies.
- Do not add new dependencies outside the approved stack without explicit approval.

## Agent Architecture
- Cato is NOT an agent - it is a chat and productivity client.
- Agent-like features for specific tasks may be added later but are not in initial scope.
- Natural language interface to productivity/commands is explicitly NOT wanted - commands use slash syntax.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Codebase Self-Documentation
- Separated modules (especially in directories) should contain a README explaining:
  - What is in the directory
  - What it is used for
  - Pointers to common functions/classes/methods
  - How to add legitimate elements
- Root-level AI guidance lives in `AGENTS.md` and `WARP.md`.
- Subdirectory `agent.md` files follow the standard in `Project/Spec/technical/TECH_CODE_ORGANISATION.md`.
- Goal: minimise code scanning by models/agents to understand the system.

### User Documentation
- In-app help must be extensive, robust, and always kept up to date.
- Help system should be easy to navigate without relying on the model.
- The model does not need to know how Cato works unless explicitly asked via `/help model`.

### System Prompt
- Base/master system prompt contains minimum needed for model to do its job.
- Master prompt is sacrosanct - changes treated as code changes.
- User system prompt is appended to master prompt.
- Model does not need awareness of UI mechanics.

## Error Handling Philosophy
- Atomic exception handling - as specific as possible.
- No broad exception catching.
- Favour catching exceptions over returning error messages from Python.
- Clear, human-readable error messages.
- Errors should be expensive and visible - don't hide problems.
- Application should almost diagnose itself.

### Logging Modes
- **Debug mode**: Extremely chatty, comprehensive logging throughout stack.
- **Warn mode**: Chatty but only relevant to user experience.
- Never do anything silently - report failures to user clearly.

## Performance Requirements
- Boot as quickly as possible - effectively instantaneous.
- All database interactions in real-time - no data caching outside context.
- **Never load entire vector store into memory**.
- No gradual streamed output required, but show waiting indicator for long responses.

## Multi-Provider Support
- Assume multiple models from multiple providers will be used.
- Assume multiple agents from multiple providers will be used.
- Architecture must support any combination.

## Future Considerations
- Architecture should allow for multimodal elements (not in initial spec).
- Headless mode for one-shot queries (limited functionality).
- Real-time context retrieval from vector store as conversation topics change.
