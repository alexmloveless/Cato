# Code Organisation Technical Specification

## Overview
Cato's codebase must be organised to minimise the effort required for any developer or AI model to understand, navigate, and modify the system.

## Directory Structure

### Root Level
- `AGENTS.md` - Repo-level AI navigation and guidance
- `WARP.md` - Warp-specific AI guidance
- `README.md` - Standard project readme
- `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` - Package configuration
- `cato/` - Main package directory

### Module Directories
Each significant module directory must contain:
- `README.md` explaining:
  - Purpose of the module
  - Key classes/functions and their roles
  - How to extend the module (e.g., adding new commands)
  - Dependencies and relationships with other modules

### Command System Organisation
Commands should be organised for easy addition:
- Individual command files or grouped by functional area
- Clear registration mechanism (decorator-based)
- Adding a new command should require:
  1. Creating/editing one file
  2. No manual registration in other files

## Subdirectory agent.md Standard
Create `agent.md` files in subdirectories that contain non-trivial code. Each file should be concise and include:
1. Purpose and scope of the directory
2. Key files and entry points
3. Public APIs or protocols defined in the directory
4. Config keys or environment variables the directory depends on
5. Common changes or extension points
6. Tests: where they live and how to run the relevant ones

## File Organisation Principles

### Single Responsibility
- Each file should have a clear, single purpose
- Avoid monolithic files with mixed concerns

### Logical Grouping
- Group related functionality in directories
- Use clear, descriptive names

### Import Structure
- Use relative imports within package
- Avoid circular imports through proper layering

## Code Documentation

### Module-Level Docstrings
Every module should have a docstring explaining:
- What the module does
- Key classes/functions exported
- Usage examples where helpful

### Function/Class Documentation
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings (numpy format)
- Type hints required for all function signatures
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic

## Extensibility Patterns

### Command Registration
```python
# Example pattern - commands register themselves
@command(name="example", aliases=["ex"])
class ExampleCommand(BaseCommand):
    """Docstring explaining the command."""
    async def execute(self, args: list[str]) -> CommandResult:
        ...
```

### Strategy Pattern for Pluggable Components
- Vector store retrieval strategies
- Chunking strategies
- Similarity algorithms
- All should follow a common interface for easy swapping

## Configuration Integration
- No hard-coded defaults in code
- All configurable values loaded from config system
- Config values accessed through typed config objects
