# Command System Specification

## Overview

Cato uses a slash command system for explicit actions. Commands start with `/` and are parsed before any other input processing.

## Command Framework

### Command Detection
Input is treated as a command if it starts with `/` (after whitespace trimming).

### Command Parsing
Commands are parsed using shell-like tokenization:
- Command name extracted after `/`
- Arguments split by whitespace
- Quoted arguments preserved as single tokens

Example:
```
/web "search query with spaces" google
```
Parses to: command=`web`, args=`["search query with spaces", "google"]`

### Command Result
Each command returns a result with:
- `success`: Boolean indicating success/failure
- `message`: User-facing message
- `data`: Optional structured data for further processing

## Command Reference

### Core Commands

#### /help
Display help information.
```
/help                    # Show overview
/help commands           # Show all commands
/help productivity       # Show productivity help
/help files              # Show file operations help
/help websearch          # Show web search help
/help speak              # Show TTS help
/help config             # Show configuration help
/help model "question"   # Ask the model about Cato (see below)
```

##### /help model
Ask the model for help with Cato functionality.
```
/help model "how do I add a new command?"
/help model "what configuration options affect the vector store?"
```

**Behavior:**
1. Loads all user help files into context
2. Creates a one-off message to the model with:
   - Help file contents
   - Instruction to derive response from help documentation
   - The user's question
3. Model responds based solely on help documentation
4. This exchange is NOT added to the conversation history
5. Does not affect the main conversation context

#### /exit, /quit, /q
Exit the application.
```
/exit
/quit
/q
```

#### /clear
Clear conversation history and screen.
```
/clear
```
Behavior:
- Removes all user/assistant messages
- Preserves system messages
- Clears terminal screen
- Displays welcome message

#### /config
Show current configuration settings.
```
/config
```
Displays table with:
- Model, temperature, max tokens
- Vector store settings
- Display settings
- Logging level

### History Commands

#### /history
Show conversation history.
```
/history        # Show all messages
/history 10     # Show last 10 messages
```

#### /delete
Remove recent exchanges from history.
```
/delete         # Remove last exchange
/delete 3       # Remove last 3 exchanges
```

#### /model
Change or display the current LLM model. This overrides the setting in the user config file.
```
/model                  # Show current model
/model gpt-4o           # Change to gpt-4o
/model claude-3-sonnet  # Change to Claude
```

#### /showsys
Display the current system prompt.
```
/showsys
```

#### /loglevel
Change logging verbosity.
```
/loglevel           # Show current level
/loglevel DEBUG     # Set to DEBUG
/loglevel INFO      # Set to INFO
/loglevel WARNING   # Set to WARNING
/loglevel ERROR     # Set to ERROR
```

### Context Commands

#### /showcontext
Toggle context display mode for all future exchanges.
```
/showcontext        # Toggle on/off (shows new state)
/showcontext on     # Enable context display with excerpts
/showcontext off    # Disable context display
/showcontext summary # Show only a count of retrieved context
```

**Behavior:**
- Acts as a **toggle** - calling `/showcontext` without arguments flips the current state
- When **on**: Context excerpts displayed before each response
- When **summary**: Only a count is displayed
- When **off**: No context information displayed (default)
- Context injection is always on when vector store is enabled and results pass the similarity threshold
- State persists for the duration of the session

#### /continue, /cont
Continue an existing conversation thread.
```
/continue <thread_id>
/cont <thread_id>
```

#### /casual
Toggle casual conversation mode.
```
/casual on      # Enable casual mode
/casual off     # Disable casual mode
```

### File Commands

/attach file1.txt file2.py file3.md  # Attach multiple (max 5)
```

## Command Extension

The command system is designed for extensibility:
- Commands registered via `@command` decorator
- BaseCommand abstract class for implementation
- CommandRegistry for lookup and alias resolution
- Async execute method for each command
